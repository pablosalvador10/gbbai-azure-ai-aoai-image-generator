# <img src="./utils/images/azure_logo.png" alt="Azure Logo" style="width:30px;height:30px;"/> Exploring Digital Content Generation with Azure OpenAI

Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to help developers construct robust architectures and applications for digital content generation using Azure OpenAI. The focus is on using the DALL-E model v3 and the GPT-Vision model to generate and refine images.

## üõ†Ô∏è From Challenges to Solutions

This guide adopts a problem-solution approach, pairing each challenge with a detailed explanation and a complementary Jupyter notebook. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the solution both conceptually and practically.

* [**Image Generation with DALL-E 3**](#image-generation-with-dall-e-3): Learn how to generate images using the DALL-E model v3.
* [**Feedback Loop using GPT-4+Vision**](#feedback-loop-using-gpt4-vision): Discover how to refine the image generation process by incorporating feedback obtained from the GPT-Vision model.
